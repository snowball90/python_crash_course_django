# Getting Started with Django

# Introduction
The purpose of this development is to learn how to use Django by building a project called Learning Log - an online journal system that helps you keep track of information for particular topics. This is an implementation of Django Web App from *Python Crash Course*.

# Test the app
- Create an environment in Python and install the dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt)
- Run in terminal: python manage.py runserver
